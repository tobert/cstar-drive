Scripts to create Cassandra USB drives handed out at Cassandra EU 2013

For this first pass, the drives were rolled by hand with a few simple scripts. In the future, this will be replaced
by an existing tool such as Packer.

I will push the code next week around 2013-10-22, after I have a little time to tidy things up.

Notes
=====

This repo is empty for now, I wanted to get it online so people can file issues for the USB drives we handed
out at Cassandra Summit EU 2013.

Please let us know if you had any problems. We will use the feedback here to improve the next version.
